**Challenges & Lessons Learned**

Data Cleaning and Transformation: One of the initial hurdles was cleaning and preparing the raw data in Power Query. I had to rename columns for clarity, correct data types (especially for temperature values that used commas instead of periods), 
and replace the numerical codes for weather and seasons with descriptive text to make the data model more intuitive.

Navigating Power BI Desktop: I ran into some difficulties with the Power BI Desktop interface, particularly in locating the Visualizations pane. 
This required me to learn the difference between the Power Query Editor and the main Report View and how to use the View tab to manage and restore the different panes.

DAX Formula Logic: A key challenge in building the KPIs was a common DAX error where a formula was trying to reference a measure before it had been created. 
This taught me the importance of defining prerequisite measures (like [Total Rentals]) before using them in more complex calculations.

Report Design and Layout: As the project grew, I ran into the design challenge of a cluttered report page. To solve this, I learned to use professional layout techniques like creating multiple pages for different aspects of the analysis 
and using tooltips to add detailed information without taking up valuable canvas space.

Project Sharing and Deployment: A final hurdle was my inability to sign up for the free Power BI Service, which meant I had to find an alternative way to showcase my interactive dashboard. 
This led me to explore and learn how to create a video walkthrough and a project summary, which ultimately resulted in a more comprehensive and well-rounded portfolio piece.
